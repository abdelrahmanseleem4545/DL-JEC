### Decoded Point Clouds for DL-JEC

This repository contains decoded (reconstructed) point clouds used in the evaluation of the paper:

**"Deep Learning-based Event Data Coding: A Joint Spatiotemporal and Polarity Solution"**  


## Description
The point clouds provided here are reconstructed event PC data by the proposed DL-JEC framework and baseline methods.
They are intended **for research and reproducibility purposes only**.
